Within a group, compare for each angle of each face, every pp's angle for the same face, but forbid same-participant comparisons and same-angle comparisons. 

Each row should have (N-1) * (4-1) comparisons. For the control group with 45 pps that is 44*3=132.

Since this is a face-based analysis, sort of face, then subj, then angle when making the list of scanpaths, 
so that when putting that wide to form the columns that sort order is respected.

'x' means an inaccurate trial was replaced with 'x' as a placemarker
'q' means the comparison is forbidden, e.g., because a subject is being compared against himself where this is not permitted
